BirdMigration | Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Folium, H3, Keras, Tensorflow | Jan 2024 - Apr 2024 | https://github.com/Meet19aug/BirdMigration
- Python & Data Analysis: Conducted a comprehensive study on flamingo migration using 168 years of GBIF.org data, focusing on North America from 2014-2024.
- Data Cleaning & Visualization: Leveraged pandas and Numpy for data processing; utilized Seaborn and Matplotlib for visualizations and folium for mapping migration routes.
- Geospatial & Statistical Analysis: Analyzed movement patterns with H3 and shapely.geometry; developed deep learning models predicting latitude and longitude with high accuracy.
- Model Performance: Achieved MAE of 6.1 (longitude) and 3.9 (latitude), showcasing advanced skills in machine learning and predictive modeling.
- API Integration: Integrated data from NASAâ€™s temperature data API, despite challenges, to explore environmental correlations with migration patterns.
